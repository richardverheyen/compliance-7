# Compliance Form Review — Team Guide

This document explains how to review the compliance forms and send feedback to Richard so he can incorporate it into the next version.

## What this tool is

A read-only viewer for the AML/compliance process forms we're building. Each form represents one compliance process (e.g. CDD for Individuals, Risk Assessment). The forms are generated by an AI pipeline from the regulatory text, and your job is to spot anything that's wrong, missing, or misleading.

## How to access it

Open the link Richard shares (a Vercel URL). No login required.

## How to leave feedback

1. **Pick a form** from the tab bar at the top.
2. **Look at the rule-code pills** — the small yellow/grey tags (e.g. `4.2.3`) scattered through each question. These link a control to a specific clause in the AML rules.
3. **Click any pill** to open a comment box. You'll see:
   - A severity selector: `Approved`, `Info`, `Warning`, or `Error`
   - A text box for your comment
4. Write your note and click **Save** (or just click away — it auto-saves).
5. A small coloured dot appears on the pill to show it has a comment.
6. Repeat across as many forms and rules as you like. Your feedback is saved automatically in your browser.

**Severity guide:**
| Level | Use when… |
|-------|-----------|
| Approved | The control looks correct — good to go |
| Info | A neutral observation or clarification |
| Warning | Something needs attention or may be wrong |
| Error | This is incorrect and must be fixed |

## Sending your feedback to Richard

When you're done with a form:

1. Look for the **"Download feedback"** link in the blue bar at the top of the form (it appears after your first comment).
2. Click it — a `.json` file will download (e.g. `risk-assessment.json`).
3. **Send that file to Richard** — email, Slack, whatever works.

If you've reviewed multiple forms, download one file per form and send them all.

> Your feedback is stored in your browser only — it does not sync between devices or team members. Download and send promptly, especially if you plan to clear your browser data.

## What Richard does with it

Richard drops each `.json` file into the project, then re-runs the AI pipeline for the affected forms. The pipeline reads your comments and uses them to fix or improve the generated controls. You'll see the changes reflected next time the Vercel link is updated.

## Recovery steps

**"I cleared my browser / switched computers and lost my feedback"**
Your feedback only lives in your browser's localStorage. If it's gone, it's gone — start again, sorry. This is why sending the download promptly matters.

**"The Download button isn't showing up"**
The button only appears after you've saved at least one comment on that form. If you've added comments but still don't see it, try saving explicitly with the Save button (rather than clicking away).

**"My comments aren't saving"**
Check that your browser allows localStorage (some privacy modes block it). Try a regular browser window rather than incognito/private mode.

**"I want to review on my phone / tablet"**
The viewer works on mobile but is easier on a wider screen. Feedback saving works the same way — localStorage is per-device, so remember to download before switching.

**"I want to clear all my feedback and start fresh for a form"**
Open your browser's developer tools (F12), go to Application → Local Storage, find entries starting with `compliance_feedback:`, and delete the relevant one. Then reload the page.
